# Product Specification: Real-Time Communication Platform

## Purpose
A platform for real-time communication (text, voice, and video) designed for individuals and communities. It enables persistent chat, voice/video channels, friend networks, and moderation tools, with extensibility for bots and third-party integrations. The backend is responsible for scalability, reliability, and real-time responsiveness.

## Goals
1. Enable low-latency, reliable communication across text, voice, and video.
2. Provide a community model with servers, roles, and permissions.
3. Ensure secure identity and access management for users.
4. Deliver persistent storage of conversations and media.
5. Support real-time presence (status, activity, typing indicators).
6. Offer extensibility through bot and integration support.
7. Maintain high availability, security, and data protection.
